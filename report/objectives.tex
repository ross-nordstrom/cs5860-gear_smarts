\section{Objectives and Timeline}
\label{section:objectives}
This project intends to apply machine learning to a real-world use case to improve understanding of
how to apply the theory. Interestingly, Gear Smarts, as so far proposed, will feature several other engineering
problems in addition to implementing a machine learning technique. Deadlines, achieved and pending, are described in a
table to help pace the project during the semester \ref{table:objectives}.
