\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
The vision and design initially proposed for GearSmarts turned out to be achievable, but with some room for improvement
with more experience and data collection. Overall, the architecture of the system turned out to be extensible enough to
support a variety of independent evaluations, while being both performant and easy-to-use. While the project fell short
in some areas relative to the vision (specifically the lack of UI), it did not impact our ability to evaluate GearSmarts.
