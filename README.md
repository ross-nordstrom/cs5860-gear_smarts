## Abstract
> This paper explores the use of machine learning classification, along with an API-consuming infrastructure, to
  produce clothing suggestions for outdoor activities based on an activity and the weather. The focus will be an
  application for suggesting which layers to wear before going out to ski or snow board.

## Contents
The contributions of this project consist of a research report, a machine learning API implementing the project, and
an App demoing the project.

### Report
(`/report`) Contains my project proposal/report and some LaTex scripting for generating it.

### API
(`/api`) Contains a Node API I'm developing for encapsulating the Machine Learning training and classification business logic.

### App
(`/app`) Contains an AngularJS app I'm developing for demoing the project and simplifying interaction with the API.
