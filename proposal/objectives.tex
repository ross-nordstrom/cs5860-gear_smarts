\section{Objectives and Timeline}
\label{section:objectives}
My goal with this project is to use machine learning in a real-world use case I would find valuable, in order to
more deeply learn machine learning and how to apply it. Interestingly, the project as I have so far proposed will
feature several other engineering problems in addition to implementing a machine learning technique. Here I will
define some deadlines to help ensure my timely completion of the project.
