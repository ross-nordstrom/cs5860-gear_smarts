\section{Proposed Design}
\label{section:propeseddesign}
To develop a climate and activity based outfit suggestion tool, I will need to break the problem into parts.
At it's core will be a Machine Learning algorithm along with a datastore for the training data. Wrapping that will
be a query system and optimistically a mobile app for training the system. Additionally, I will need to determine 
the best way to represent the problem set in terms of features. Here, I break down the parts of the system and what
work I envision is needed.

\subsection{Learning Core}
Firstly, I will need to determine the best Machine Learning method to use. I have found a number of articles on
