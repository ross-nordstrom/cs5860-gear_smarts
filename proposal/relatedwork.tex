\section{Related Work}
\label{section:relatedwork}
While there have been a number of works in automating outfit selection, they are all geared towards
fashion selection either for aesthetics or occasions (e.g. wedding, funeral, interview, church, etc.).
I have not been able to find any existing work in the climate-outfitting field, let alone with an
activity focus.

In general, the related works I have found fall into three categories: fashionable outfit selection, category-based 
outfit selection, and general temperature/climate automation. Here I give a brief description of the related works
I have found:

\subsection{Fashionable Outfit Selection}
\begin{description}
  \item{Dressup!: Outfit Synthesis Through Automatic Optimization:} Uses a wardrobe of known clothes to suggest 
  outfits based on your appearance. Of note is that outfits are suggested based on a dress code constraint \cite{Dressup}.
  \item{Rethinking the Smart Closet As an Opportunity to Enhance the Social Currency of Clothing:} Outfit selection and 
  sharing focused on comparing and lending wardrobe to other \cite{SmartCloset}.
  \item{Hi, Magic Closet, Tell Me What to Wear!} The researchers used Amazon's mechanical turks to fill a database
  of available-to-purchase outfits. Using this dataset, they constructed an occasion-oriented outfit suggestion
  tool \cite{MagicCloset}.
  \item{Understanding Adaptive Thermal Comfort: New Directions for UbiComp:} While unrelated to outfit planning, this
  paper discusses a new approach to thermal control of homes. This could relate well to adapting my system to sub-activities
  with different thermal properties (e.g. mogul vs groomer skiing) \cite{ThermalComfort}.
